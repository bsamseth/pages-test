# pages-test

This repository doesn't really contain anything, I just wanted to test out the Github Pages functionality.

Here is a link to the [license](LICENSE), since I have little else in this repo to link to.

## Here is a level 2 heading

### And look, a level 3 heading as well!

This one has some code:

``` python
def print(*words):
  for word in words:
    print(word, end='')
   print()
print('Hello', ', ', 'World!')
```
